# CapitalOneChallenge

## Description

I made this program as part of an entry to attend Capital One's Software Engineering Summit
My entry was voted top 30 in the nation and I was selected to attend this event along with
other excelling students across the US. 

## How to run

To run this program, you will need to have an Instagram API key and an indico API key, both
of which are free. Place that in the CapitalOneChallenge.py (the variables for both are defined at the top as globals so it shouldn't be too hard.

You can also change the hashtag if you would like to analyze data for a different tag.
